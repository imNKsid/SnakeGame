# SnakeGame

Hi, I'm making the Snake Game with two famous CLIs, Expo, and React Native.
Why Expo CLI? Because I wanted to learn the fundamentals of Expo CLI, as I haven't used it.
Why React Native CLI? Because I wanted to do the same thing with some extra effort. Also to share among friends.

--- IMPORTANT ---

1. Make sure to switch to the specific folder in the terminal while running the project, either "WithExpoCLI" or "WithReactNativeCLI".
2. Once you switch, be sure to install the dependent packages.
3. If you are in the 'WithExpoCLI' folder, enter -> npm install to install all the dependencies.
4. If you are in the 'WithReactNativeCLI' folder, enter -> yarn/yarn install to install all the dependencies.

Before running, if you want to download the build(.apk file) and run it. You can do so with this link -
